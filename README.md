# Serverless VSCode Debug TypeScript

Demo project on setting up a serverless API on [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) using the [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for debugging (breakpoints yay!).

Local development is executed with the [`serverless-offline`](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) plugin.
